rigel - Open-source program loader/reader for PIC18F devices using the AN851 
bootloader protocol.

Rigel is a complete, free replacement for the IFI_Loader tool from
Innovation First for the FIRST Robotics Competition. It should support any 
PIC18F device that loads programs via the AN851 (or a 100% compatible, 
like that from IFI) bootloader protocol through a serial port interface.
Rigel is 100% POSIX compliant and has no dependencies other than libc;
to compile on Windows, you must use Cygwin.

PLEASE NOTE that in order for rigel to be able to open the serial port on UNIX,
one of the following conditions must be true:
    - You own (or your group owns) the serial port you are using, or rw- perms
      are enabled for your user on that port.
    - You are running rigel as the root user.
    
Typical usage:

To load a compiled program to your device, verifying each write:
$ rigel --verify racknroll.hex

To update the master firmware (automatically verifies each write):
$ rigel --master FRC_MASTER_V13.BIN

To read program memory to working.hex:
$ rigel --read working.hex

To dump the AN851 bootloader code in binary format:
$ rigel --read=boot --format=raw an851.bin

To display some of the configuration registers on your device:
$ rigel --configreg

To load a binary file to EEPROM memory:
$ rigel --eeprom --format=raw calibration.bin
or from a HEX file:
$ rigel --eeprom eedata.hex

To specify a non-default serial port:
$ rigel --serial=/dev/ttyS2 test.hex
$ rigel --serial=/dev/tty.serial --master FRC_MASTER_V13.BIN
